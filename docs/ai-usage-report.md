# AI Usage Report (Assignment 1)

## Tools Used & Use Cases
### ChatGPT
- Generated an initial layout plan (sections: About, Projects, Contact).
- Suggested responsive CSS ideas (Grid/Flex + breakpoints).
- Helped draft documentation files (README + technical documentation).
- Helped write JavaScript features (theme toggle, smooth scroll, form validation).

## Benefits & Challenges
### Benefits
- Faster development: got a working structure quickly.
- Better organization: consistent folder structure and documentation.
- Learned practical UI patterns.

### Challenges
- Some AI suggestions were too generic and needed adjustments.
- I had to test responsiveness manually and tweak CSS breakpoints.

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of responsive layouts using Grid/Flexbox.
- Learned how to store user preferences with localStorage.
- Practiced basic form validation and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

## Responsible Use & Modifications
- I did not copy-paste blindly. I reviewed each suggestion and edited it.
- I tested the site in DevTools.
- I ensured the final code matches assignment requirements and is understandable.
